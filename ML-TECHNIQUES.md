# ML-based Subdomain Discovery

This process utiliese NN (Neural Networks) with the hope that it may extend the finalist with more dataset then expected. RNN’s (Recurrent Neural Networks) excel at solving sequence-based problems and utilize a ‘memory’ to learn from previous iterations. NLP (Natural Language Processing) is the machine text classification and text generation process. 

The RNN is essentially emulating a human brain and learning speech patterns based on the textual data it is fed. As it interprets this data, it is learning the structure and style of the language and can then generate predictive text based on that input.

We can use this to create a subdomain name generator, based on Yugoslavic language such is used in Bosnia-Herz./Serbia/Croatia. Tricks and tips are investigeted using [LSTM](https://livecodestream.dev/post/lstm-based-name-generator-first-dive-into-nlp/) algorithm which concats NLP with the RNN techniques. Some other resources are in [Affinis](https://phoenix-sec.io/2022/07/12/RNN-Subdomain-Discovery.html) documentation and [source code](https://github.com/JetP1ane/Affinis).
