## Description

`subdomains-cro` is the security tester's companion. It's a collection of a subdomain lists used during security assessments, collected in one place, prototyped and translted to Yugoslavian langauges. List type incluides typical network, username, sensitive design patterns, fuzzing payloads and many more to easily enumerate and recon potential Yugoslavian subdomains. Can be used with: [gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster), [amass](https://github.com/OWASP/Amass), [sublist3r](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r) and many others.

This project is mainained by [durakiconsulting](https://github.com/durakiconsulting/) and friendship haxors.

### Getting started

- [ ] Gather all interesting subdomain and DNS wordlists in one place (SecList, Jihadx, etc.)
- [Â ] Use Translating Engine (ie. Google Translate) to Translate words from `EN` -> `CRO` from default wordlists
- [ ] Use [crt.sh](https://crt.sh) in combination with .BA/.HR/.RS DNS Zone List (from [nettis](https://github.com/durakiconsulting/nettis))
- [ ] Store all cert/transparency discovered subdomains to a new list
- [Â ] Use [gorilla](https://github.com/d4rckh/gorilla) & [cook](https://github.com/giteshnxtlvl/cook) to permutate subdomain words
- [ ] Final compilation of all unique/translated/fabricated subdomain words

### Features

- Subdomain words in Croatian/Serbian/Bosnian
- Brainstorming new potential ideas
- Technical Details on Pre-Enumeration, Generation and Compilation
- Additional Mutation Techniques
- Never-seen ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡· subdomain wordlist (who would say ExYu is coming back? :)

## Install

**Zip**

```
get -c https://github.com/durakiconsulting/subdomains-cro/archive/master.zip -O subdomains-cro.zip \
  && unzip subdomains-cro.zip \
  && rm -f subdomains-cro.zip
```

```

### Building

You will need a zonelist of prefered choice for specific ccTLD. This is not provided in the repository. Upon gathering an sqlite3 database of zonelist, you need to execute the following commands:

```
$ ./scripts/ba-domains_extract.sh     # => this will extract `url` column from `domains` table of the sqlite database
ba-domains_extract.sh successfully extracted
output is (bytes+lines): szone/cctld-ba_nett.txt
  657060 subdomains-cro/scripts/../szone/cctld-ba_nett.txt
   10951 subdomains-cro/scripts/../szone/cctld-ba_nett.txt

$ ruby scripts/ba-domains_clean.rb    # => this uses previously extracted `url`-set to compile a newly clean cctld list
...
input is (szone/cctld-ba_nett.txt) => output is (szone/clean_cctld-ba_nett.txt)
total lines to process ... ~(10951)
domain (058.ba) in progress ... no_unknw
